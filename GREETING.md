MENA Devs was first launched in January, 2015 with the purpose of connecting Software Developers, Engineers and Computer Enthusiasts in the MENA region. What started as a Slack group has evolved to become a vibrant community of 360+ members engaging in daily discussions in software, and web development, tools of the trade, work methodologies and workflows, and technical management styles (to name a few of the popular topics).

We are looking forward to your active contributions to the community while appreciating you following our basic guidelines and Code of Conduct (CoC) [https://github.com/mena-devs/code-of-conduct]:

* Respect other members of the group and let this CoC guide your actions.

* We encourage freedom of speech and we will try to avoid content censoring, however, apply the utmost consideration for the content discussed or shared by flagging NSFW material, avoiding profanities, and avoiding malicious commentary.
